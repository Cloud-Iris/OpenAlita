# Open-Alita

Open-Alita is a generalist agent designed to enable scalable agentic reasoning with minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution. This project leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to dynamically create, adapt, and reuse capabilities based on the demands of various tasks, moving away from the reliance on predefined tools and workflows.

## Features

- **Minimal Predefinition**: Equipped with a minimal set of core capabilities, allowing for flexibility and adaptability.
- **Maximal Self-Evolution**: The agent can autonomously create and refine external capabilities as needed.
- **Dynamic MCP Creation**: Alita can generate and adapt MCPs on-the-fly, enhancing its ability to tackle diverse tasks.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd Open-Alita
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the agent, you can use the following command:

```bash
python -m src.agent.mcp
```

Make sure to configure the necessary parameters in the code or through command-line arguments as needed.
