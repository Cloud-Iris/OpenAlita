Find the fractions that use / as the fraction line before the sample problems start: 3/4,1/4,3/4,3/4,2/4,1/2,5/35,7/21,30/5,30/5\n2. Solve the sample problems:\n3. Problem 1: 3/4\n4. Problem 2: 1/15\n5. Problem 3: 1/3\n6. Problem 4: 4/9\n7. Problem 5: 1/8\n8. Problem 6: 32/23\n9. Problem 7: 103/170\n10: Add them to the list. There were no more fractions with a / as the fraction line, so they can just be added in order: 3/4,1/4,3/4,3/4,2/4,1/2,5/35,7/21,30/5,30/5,3/4,1/15,1/3,4/9,1/8,32/23,103/170", "Number of steps": "10", "How long did this take?": "5 minutes", "Tools": "1. image recognition/OCR\n2. calculator", "Number of tools": "2"}}
